Python NIST Randomness Beacon
=============================

**WARNING: DO NOT USE BEACON GENERATED VALUES AS SECRET CRYPTOGRAPHIC
KEYS.**

Installation
============

Prerequisites
-------------

A required library :code:`pycrypto` is used with :code:`nistbeacon`.

Ubuntu, and other Linux-based users should have :code:`python3-dev` installed.

.. code:: bash

    apt-get install python3-dev

Installing :code:`nistbeacon`
-----------------------------

To install the beacon library, simply use :code:`pip`:

.. code:: bash

    pip install nistbeacon

Beacon Usage
============

It is easy to use the beacon. Most queries are performed through
:code:`NistBeacon` which produces :code:`NistBeaconValue` objects.

Beacon Sample Code
------------------

.. code:: python

    from nistbeacon import NistBeacon

    # In the examples below I will be using 1447873020
    # as my <timestamp> when required

    # Current Record (or next closest)
    # https://beacon.nist.gov/rest/record/<timestamp>
    record = NistBeacon.get_record(1447873020)

    # Previous Record
    # https://beacon.nist.gov/rest/record/previous/<timestamp>
    prev_record = NistBeacon.get_previous(1447873020)

    # Next Record
    # https://beacon.nist.gov/rest/record/next/<timestamp>
    next_record = NistBeacon.get_next(1447873020)

    # First Record
    # https://beacon.nist.gov/rest/record/1378395540
    first_record = NistBeacon.get_first_record(download=True)

    # Last Record
    # https://beacon.nist.gov/rest/record/last
    last_record = NistBeacon.get_last_record()

    # Verify the record and the record chain
    record_chain_result = NistBeacon.chain_check(1447873020)

Beacon Value
============

The :code:`NistBeaconValue` objects act as basic python objects.
As one would expect, there are a number of properties and methods available
on it.

Beacon Value Instance
---------------------

.. code:: python

    """
    :param version:
        Reported NIST randomness beacon version

    :param frequency:
        The time interval, in seconds, between expected records

        seconds since January 1, 1970

        value

        string

        A digital signature (RSA) computed over (in order): version,
        frequency, timeStamp, seedValue, previousHashValue, statusCode

        representations and not the string representations of the data
        values

            1 - Start of a new chain of values, previous hash value
                will be all zeroes
